Newgame.Demo=You've started a new game.  Use WASD to control your character, and E to interact with objects in the environment.  More functionality will likely follow as the game continues to be improved.  Right now, there isn't much of any actual stuff you\ncan *do* in this game; you're looking at a very simple tech demo.  There isn't even game saving yet!  There is game loading, but without saving that isn't going to do you much good~ :)
